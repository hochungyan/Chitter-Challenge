I want to receive an email if I am tagged in a Peep

As a trainee
In order to start a conversation as a DFA trainee Software Engineer

Note:
I took a lot of inspiration from Lucas work and the Simple login in file.
The Peep wont' submit unless you press twice
I build the login in page first then build up the peep function.
```
